# 3-Band Audio Compressor

A 3-band audio compressor with JUCE framework. This compressor is a powerful tool for shaping the sound of your music. It features three bands of compression, each with its own threshold, ratio, attack, and release controls. You can also use the sidechain input to control the compression of a specific frequency range.

## Features
* 3-band compression
* Threshold, ratio, attack, and release controls for each band
* Sidechain input
* Stereo and mono linking modes
* Metering for gain reduction and output level
* Oversampling for high-quality audio

## Requirements
* JUCE framework
* A compatible host application (e.g., Logic Pro X, Ableton Live, Studio One)

## Installation
* Clone this repository.
* In the project directory, run make.
* The compressor will be built in the build directory.
* Copy the .vst or .au file to the plugins directory of your host application.

## Usage
* Add the compressor to your host application.
* Set the threshold, ratio, attack, and release controls to taste.
* Use the sidechain input to control the compression of a specific frequency range.
* Monitor the gain reduction and output level meters to ensure that the compressor is not over-compressing your audio.
